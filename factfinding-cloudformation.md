## <span style="color:#FF5733"> 1. What is Configuration Orchestration? </span> 
 
- A way of automating the deployment and management of infrastructure and applications.
- This involves using tools to define the desired state of infrastructure and applications, and then automatically deploying and managing them to match that state.
- This can help to ensure that systems are deployed and configured consistently and reliably.
 
## <span style="color:#FF5733">2. What is Configuration Management? List some commonly used tools for Configuration Management. </span>
 
- The process of managing and controlling the configuration of IT systems.
- This involves ensuring that systems are configured in a consistent and reliable way, and that changes are made in a controlled and auditable manner.
- This can help to prevent errors and ensure that systems are always in a known state.



- Commonly used tools for Configuration Management:

## <span style="color:#FF5733">3. What is Continuous Integration? </span>
 
- A software development practice where developers regularly merge their code into a shared repository.
- This enables automated builds and testing to be run on the merged code, which helps to identify and fix problems early in the development process.
  
## <span style="color:#FF5733"> 4. What is Continuous Delivery?  </span>
 
- A software development practice where all code changes are automatically deployed to production.
- This enables developers to release software more frequently and with less risk, and to get feedback from users more quickly.
 
## <span style="color:#FF5733">5. What is AWS CloudFormation? List 3 advantages of CloudFormation </span>
 
<p align="center"> <img src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/6261056/screenshots/14660465/media/a608639b24d21d75eae965deb1a9f797.gif" alt="drawing" width="900" height="600"/> </p>

- An infrastructure as code (IaC) service that enables you to model and provision AWS cloud resources in a safe, reliable, and repeatable way with automation.
- CloudFormation uses templates to define the desired state of infrastructure resources, and then provisions and manages those resources based on the template.

- Advantages of CloudFormation:

1. Repeatable deployments: CloudFormation templates allow you to define your infrastructure in a declarative way, which means that you can deploy your infrastructure the same way every time.
2. Reduced errors: CloudFormation templates are validated by AWS, which helps to reduce the number of errors that you make when deploying your infrastructure.
3. Ease of use: CloudFormation templates are easy to write and understand, which makes them a good choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

 
## <span style="color:#FF5733">6. What is JSON and YAML? List 3 differences between them. </span>
 
-JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) are both human-readable data interchange formats.
-They are both used to represent data structures, such as arrays and objects.
-Differences between JSON and YAML:
```
- Syntax: JSON has a stricter syntax than YAML.
- Whitespace: YAML is whitespace-sensitive, while JSON is not.
- Comments: YAML supports comments, while JSON does not.
```

 
## <span style="color:#FF5733">7. What is a stack in AWS CloudFormation? </span>
 
- A collection of AWS resources that are created and managed together as a single unit.
- You can use CloudFormation to create stacks for a variety of purposes, such as deploying applications, provisioning databases, and creating virtual private clouds (VPCs).
