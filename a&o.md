## 
```
*Management- Both -  One team can be managed which is automation, and multiple teams can be managed which is orchestration.

*Python Script-	Both - Python can automate one task in a script or automate multiple which is orchestration.

*Provisioning-	Orchestration - Provisioning is the process of creating and setting up IT infrastructure which is comprised of
 multiple tasks and therefore if automated is orchestration.

*Code-	Both - Code can automate one task in a script or automate multiple which is orchestration.

*Single Task - Automation  -  Involves the process of automating a single task.		

*Process coordination - Orchestration - involves managing multiple tasks or processes to achieve a larger goal.			

*Infrastructure - Both - Involves configuring individual components within the infrastructure and managing multiple infrastructure
 components to create a holistic system.

*HCL Configuration Language- Both - HCL is used for defining and configuring infrastructure elements and can also be used to define
 how different components interact with each other.

*Eliminating repetition is achieved through both automation and orchestration. Automation removes individual repetitive tasks,
 while orchestration coordinates these tasks into efficient workflows, leading to improved efficiency and reduced errors when used together.			

*User-defined function is a form of automation, allowing users to automate specific tasks. 
It becomes part of orchestration when multiple functions are coordinated in a larger workflow. 

*Increasing reliability is a goal achieved through both automation and orchestration. Automation reduces errors in routine tasks,
 while orchestration ensures consistency by managing and coordinating automated processes.

*Terraform is primarily an automation tool, automating the provisioning and management of infrastructure.
 While it focuses on automation, it can also be integrated into orchestration workflows to manage infrastructure within larger, coordinated processes.	

*Version control- Automation - involves the use of tools like Git and Subversion to automatically track,
 manage, and document changes made to files and code. It streamlines collaboration, conflict resolution,
  and code deployment while  providing a historical record of all modifications.

*Unit test-	Automation - involves the automated execution of scripted test cases on individual software components. This automation provides efficiency,
 consistency, precision, and reproducibility in testing, making it an essential part of quality assurance

*Decrease IT cost- Both - by streamlining processes, optimizing resource usage,
 and reducing manual effort and coordinating complex workflows to be more efficient.	

*Thread creation- Automation - thread creation automates the concurrent execution of tasks, improving efficiency and resource utilization.
 This technique is useful for reducing processing time and enhancing system responsiveness in scenarios where tasks can run in parallel.

*Decrease friction among teams- both - can help reduce friction among teams by streamlining and automating repetitive team-based tasks,
 making communication and collaboration smoother.

*Increase productivity - automation - does task quickly and accurately so not too much time spent. Automation is more efficent than orchestration.

* PyCharm - automation - is an IDE used for automating tasks through Python scripting and coding.
 It's a tool that helps automate the process of writing and running Python programs efficiently.

*Workflow - orchestration -  is like the boss that makes sure everyone knows what to do and when to do it,
 so the project goes smoothly and gets finished on time.
